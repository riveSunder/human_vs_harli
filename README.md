# Can you beat a bot? 

It goes without saying that an optimization agent is going to try to optimize a given objective, whether you like it or not! This project pits you, the human, against an evolved meta-learning cellular automata agent. In a simulation with changing physics and an obscure scoring function, can you figure out the rules of the universe in time to outscore a reward-hacking bot?

HARLI takes inspiration in part from the differentiable neural cellular automata described in the [thread](https://distill.pub/2020/selforg/) on distill.pub on differentiable self-organizing systems, and Hebbian learning from random parameter initializations is adapted from Najarro and Risi's [Meta-Learning through Hebbian Plasticity in Random Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02686). The source code for HARLI is available for your perusal [here](https://github.com/riveSunder/harli_learning/blob/master/game_of_carle/agents/harli.py).
